about=The TNC Carbon Calculator is used to estimate carbon density from remotely sensed pictures taken from drones depending on the biome. It currently accepts only Point Cloud and Canopy Height Model inputs. 
    This plugin was developed for QGIS with the objective of democratizing access to remote sensing–based methodologies for estimating aboveground vegetation biomass and carbon stocks. It is intended for society as a whole, particularly researchers and technical staff from environmental NGOs, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), and public-sector managers who use data from low-cost drones (equipped with RGB, multispectral, or LiDAR sensors), including intermediate products such as Canopy Height Models (CHM) or point clouds, to calculate biomass and carbon estimates in a fast, replicable, and scientifically robust manner. Integrated into the QGIS workflow, the plugin applies models calibrated for the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, and Amazon biomes using forest inventory data and LiDAR measurements, supporting ecological restoration monitoring, carbon credit initiatives, and MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) systems, while expanding the scale and frequency of environmental monitoring in the context of climate change.
